# Tripwire Tips and Tricks

## General Guidelines

## Copy-pasting Signatures

## Tabs

Tabs can be added from the wormhole chain window by click the plus icon `+`:

There are two types of tabs you can add:

* **K-space tab** - displays all wormhole chains which have a kspace exit, either added by you or your fellow alliance members. You can create a `K-space tab` like this (you can give it any other name):

* **System tab** - displays the wormhole chain which contains the system specified. This is similar to a bookmark and it's useful when you're monitoring multiple systems. You can create a `System tab` like shown below (you can give it any other name). This is also nice if you want to keep the chain displayed without in-game tracking disrupting the view:

## Comments

Comments can be added/edited/deleted from the comment window. These are basically notes on the selected system and it's good practice to leave notes containing intel or any other sort of information you might think will be useful for you or your fellow alliance members. This is how you add comments:

Feel free to change the formatting (text size, color, etc.) if you want to make it more readable. Do not delete comments made by your fellow alliance members unless you are 100% certain the comment is not applicable anymore. In this case it might be better to cross out the text or ~~strikethrough~~ the old notes. If uncertain, just ask.

## Specifying class without jumping the K162

It is good practice to specify the signature ID, type, life, mass of a wormhole and where it leads to, even for `K162` wormholes. You can even specify the destination class without jumping the wormhole:

Notice the `Class-3` in the "**Leads**" field. This is useful for `K162` types. Here is a list of generic destinations you can specify:

* High-Sec
* Low-Sec
* Null-Sec
* Class-1
* Class-2
* Class-3
* Class-4
* Class-5
* Class-6

You may ask how you can distinguish between C1, C2 and C3 wormholes and between C4 and C5 wormholes. You can visually identify them by following this guide: [Wormhole Visual Identification](whvisual.md). It takes some practice but you will find it very useful.

## Gate Connections

## Flares

Flares can be added/deleted by right-clicking a system in the wormhole chain window and assigning one of three colors as shown in the screenshot below. You might need to refresh by left-clicking on the selected system to be able to view the flare you added.

There may be some variations, but the most used convention is this:

* **red** - the target system where a battle takes place or will take place (wait for the FC to give you the approval to jump this system)
* **yellow** - the system where the fleet assembles or holds just before jumping the target red system
* **green** - usually a staging system or a secondary fleet operation/battle

## Mass

You can see what ships have passed through a wormhole connection by right-clicking a system and clicking on the `Mass` option. You have to right-click on a different system than the one you have selected. This will give you info about the pilot, direction, ship, mass and time. Note that the mass is calculated from the ship's base mass and does not include modifiers like plates or prop mods:

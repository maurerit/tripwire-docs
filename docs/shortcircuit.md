# Short Circuit

Short Circuit (formerly known as Pathfinder) is a desktop application and an extension to Tripwire. It is able to find the shortest path between solar systems (including wormholes) using Tripwire data. For example, this may prove useful when you need to travel very fast between wormhole chains.
